# Summerization

If you have large content and you want to summerize the content.
Approch 1: - Add stuff  the summery to LLM ; This will lead to no ouput(for large document)
This approch is called ```stuff method```
                                                                        
Approch 2: Summerize all the content ```independtly``` and send all summary documents to LLM, from there we can summerize the final one.
This appoarch is called ```mapreduce apporch```
                                                                        T
            
                                                                        T
