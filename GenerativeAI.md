Examples:
  Text Generation: Writin emails, essay ,Poem
  Writing code: Write,debug, Analyze programs
 Image Generation: Creating  paintings,drawing or other forms of images

## Artifical Intelligence
Create machines that can simulate human Intelligence like Behavior

## Machine learning 
learning from examples

## Generative AI
Learning from examples to create a new content ; In order to create a generative AI model we need huge volumes of data
- data from Wikipedia
- Data from books
- Open source code
- Converation 

## A key step In Generative AI For Text - Next Word

context ::```The cat sat on the ```
Example Probablities for the next word ```mat: 0.4, table: 0.2, chair: 0.2"
Model will choose based on the heighest probable
