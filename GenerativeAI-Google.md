# Foundation model: Trained on Massive datasets
- can generated text/code or audio
- Available in the model garden
- Large language model(LLM): Focus only on Language(Text,Chat)
- PaLM API can be used in google as well as outside of Google.

```Gen-AI studio,Gen AI App builder and Maker suite``` use the functional suite ; we can create a generative AI without coding experience
