Goal: Make a good prediction
Gives Input to the model
Model returns the prediction
Inputs are called ```Features```
Predictons are ```Labels```
Example:  Used car price model
Label: Price
Features: Manufacturer, year, Model, age, conditions, cylinder, locations

## Creating Machine Models- Steps
- Optain Data
- Clean Data;; missing data ;; wrong data
- Features Engineering: Identify Features and Labels
  In the given data we need to identify which feilds are important
  
- Create a model using the dataset
    - Create a ML algo

- Evaluate the accuracy of the model
    - validate with given input
      
- Deploy the model for use

Note:: Step 4-5 are done in a cycle till exact ouput is obtained


Training: The process of Creating Model
Evaluations: Is the model working
Inference: Using model to do predictions in production

## Dataset
There are 3 datasets
  - Training Dataset
  - Validation Dataset: Dataset used to validate the model;; TO check the accuracy
  - Testing Dataset::- final testing
