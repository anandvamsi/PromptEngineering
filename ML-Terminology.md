Goal: Make a good prediction
Gives Input to the model
Model returns the prediction
Inputs are called ```Features```
Predictons are ```Labels```
Example:  Used car price model
Label: Price
Features: Manufacturer, year, Model, age, conditions, cylinder, locations

## Creating Machine Models- Steps
- Optain Data
- Clean Data
- Features Engineering: Identify Features and Labels
- Create a model using the dataset
- Evaluate the accuracy of the model
- Deploy the model for use


Training: The process of Creating Model
Evaluations: Is the model working
Inference: Using model to do predictions in production
